# ShekseCodeSync — Decision Log

A running record of the significant decisions and their rationale. Newest sections appended over time.

## 2026-07-25 — Product & architecture (PRD sign-off)

| # | Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Audience | Multi-user product with accounts | Accounts, auth, per-user repos & data isolation from day one |
| 2 | Source of truth | GitHub is SoT, DB is a rebuildable index | Content diffable/shareable in Git; DB serves dashboard & revision queries |
| 3 | Platforms at launch | LeetCode + NeetCode | Pluggable capture adapters from the start |
| 4 | AI timing | Auto on capture, **fire-and-forget** | API returns 200 after GitHub+DB, then queues the AI job; worker enriches later & retries |
| 5 | Deployment | Self-hosted, Docker on homelab | Container images + docker-compose; deps self-containable |
| 6 | Spaced repetition | Yes — Anki-style scheduling (v2) | Self-rated revision attempts drive an SRS scheduler; needs its own table |
| 7 | GitHub auth | GitHub App (not OAuth App / PAT) | Fine-grained, per-repo, revocable, short-lived tokens. Plugin never holds GitHub creds. |
